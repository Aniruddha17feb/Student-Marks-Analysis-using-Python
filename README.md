# Student-Marks-Analysis-using-Python
This project analyzes student scores in math, reading, and writing, along with factors like gender, parental education, marital status, and transport means. Using Python libraries, I performed EDA with visualizations such as box plots and heatmaps. The analysis reveals the impact of parental education and minimal effect of marital status on scores.
